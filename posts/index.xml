They are painfully slow and charge fees for everything. You are locked into a single vendor and their whole closed ecosystem and then one day, they obsolete your cameras and you are left with perfectly good hardware that does nothing.
You can build your own security camera system that will work much better and be much cheaper than anything Ring, Nest, or Arlo can offer.</description></item></channel></rss>
