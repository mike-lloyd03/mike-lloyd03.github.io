They are painfully slow and charge fees for everything. You are locked into a single vendor and their whole closed ecosystem and then one day, they obsolete your cameras and you are left with perfectly good hardware that does nothing.
You can build your own security camera system that will work much better and be much cheaper than anything Ring, Nest, or Arlo can offer.</description></item><item><title>I am Fully Self-Hosted Now</title><link>https://mike-lloyd03.github.io/posts/home-server-setup/</link><pubDate>Mon, 21 Mar 2022 22:11:31 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://mike-lloyd03.github.io/posts/home-server-setup/</guid><description>For the most part.
I started this journey towards self-hosting with a Raspberry Pi 2 back in November 2020 and I just finished deleting everything out of my Google Drive and Google Photos. I still have Gmail because it&amp;rsquo;s a good junk mail pit but other than that, I have migrated all of my cloud services to my home server. It feels pretty good to be out of the cloud and to have total ownership of my data.</description></item></channel></rss>
